    <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
    <br>
    <p>I'm a student studying mass communication, an aspiring frontend web developer and an apprentice in fashion design.
     I choose to learn frontend web development because i do love the sight of a beautiful website and i'v always
     wish to learn how to create them. For the past six months in learning frontend development, i've not been consistent (school issues).So i joined this JustProject group to help me in being consistent and skillful.</p>
